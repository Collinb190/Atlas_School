.SH NAME
Holberton Shell \- A simple UNIX command line interpreter.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B holberton_shell

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B holberton_shell
is a simple UNIX command line interpreter developed as a Holberton School project. It allows users to enter commands and executes them.

.SH OPTIONS
The
.B holberton_shell
does not take any options. However, you can supply a command.

.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.B exit
Exits the shell.

.TP
.B env
Prints the current environment.

.SH INTERACTIVE MODE
In interactive mode, the shell displays a prompt (#cisfun$) and waits for the user to enter a command. It will display the prompt again after executing a command.

.SH COMMAND LINES
Command lines are simple and do not support semicolons, pipes, redirections, or other advanced features. If an executable is not found, an error message is displayed.

.SH HANDLING ERRORS
The shell handles errors gracefully and provides meaningful error messages.

.SH END OF FILE CONDITION
The shell handles the end-of-file condition (Ctrl+D) appropriately.

.SH BUGS
There is a known issue related to the exit command when combined with invalid commands. For example, entering "qwerty exit" does not exit the shell with the correct status and instead displays an error message ("qwerty: not found") and returns to the prompt. The expected behavior would be to exit with a status of 127. Developers are actively working to address this issue in future releases.
